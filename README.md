# SimlpeGameWithLiveData

A simple project with Kotlin & Live Data.

### Hi👋

I'm **Zahra Davardoust** ☺️

Today We learn a game with  Live Data 🚀


[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/LiveData) is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services. This awareness ensures LiveData only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state.
